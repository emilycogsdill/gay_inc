# Gay, Inc.

https://is.gay

This is, in fact, a real website that does real things, kind of. As of right now it is mostly me (Emily) figuring out how to full-stack-develop(?) enough to create a functioning corner of the internet that does something.

### What it does

Gay Inc. is a purveyor of fine subdomains.

### Features!

Users can do these wondrous feats: 

* Register with an account (username and password!)
* Login and log out (wow!)
* Add and delete subdomains

Okay, that is not many features yet. But we are making progress!
